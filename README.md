Make your 3D printer play music while It heats

##Introduction
If you own or have used a 3D printer, you doubtless know that, unless your's is equipped with "silent" stepper drivers, 3D printers make a whole range of interesting noises while they operate.

A second thing you probably know if you 3D print often is that it can take a little while for both the hotend and the bed to come up to temperature in preparation for a print job.

Well, with the firmware in this repository, you can make the time spent waiting for the printer to heat up a bit more entertaining. By making use of acoustic science and clever timing, we will make your 3D printer play a little tune as it is heating. The cool thing is that we will perform this upgrade without adding any hardware to your printer - no speakers even!

We will make use of an age-old hack to play music using stepper motors by making them vibrate at specific frequencies. With a couple modifications to the Marlin firmware and a few extra files on the SD card, your 3D printer can play a lovely song before your print begins.

## Installation
Instructions for installing the firmware onto your Creatlity Ender 3 and creating music files to place on the SD card can be found on Instructables [link TBA after Instructable is published].
